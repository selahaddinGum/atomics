abstract  ="Autocatalysis is fundamental to many biological processes{,} and kinetic models of autocatalytic reactions have mathematical forms similar to activation functions used in artificial neural networks. Inspired by these similarities{,} we use an autocatalytic reaction{,} the copper-catalyzed azideâ€“alkyne cycloaddition{,} to perform digital image recognition tasks. Images are encoded in the concentration of a catalyst across an array of liquid samples{,} and the classification is performed with a sequence of automated fluid transfers. The outputs of the operations are monitored using UV-vis spectroscopy. The growing interest in molecular information storage suggests that methods for computing in chemistry will become increasingly important for querying and manipulating molecular memory."}
