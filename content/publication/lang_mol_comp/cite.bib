abstract = {Advances in molecular computing have been thwarted by the lack of theoretical underpinnings that are both generalizable and experimentally practical. In a recent issue of iScience, Dueñas-Díez and Pérez-Mercader begin to fill this void by illustrating the correspondence between Chomsky’s hierarchy of formal grammars and example chemical automata.}
